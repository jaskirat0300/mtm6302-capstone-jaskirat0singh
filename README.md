## Overview

The design mockup for the Pokémon web application was created with a clean and modern layout in mind, focusing on usability, readability, and responsiveness. The application contains three main pages: Pokémon Gallery, Pokémon Detail, and Caught Pokémon, each structured with consistent design elements such as navigation, a content section, and buttons.

## Design Decisions

### 1. Header and Navigation
- **Consistency**: All pages share the same header layout, which includes a logo on the left and navigation items on the right. This maintains consistency across the entire application.
- **Minimalist Styling**: The header uses a simple design with clean lines.

### 2. Pokemon Gallery
- **Grid Layout**: The Pokémon Gallery features a flexible grid layout that dynamically adjusts to the screen size. Each Pokémon card includes the name of the Pokémon and a "View Image" button.
- **Load More Button**: To improve performance and avoid overwhelming the user with too much content at once, the gallery initially loads a limited number of Pokémon, with an option to "Load More." This gives users control over how much content is displayed, improving usability and performance.

### 3. Pokemon Card Design
- **Card Layout**: Each Pokémon is displayed inside a card with the image on the left and the Pokémon's name and "View Image" button on the right. This layout ensures important information is easily accessible.
- **Interactive Button**: The "View Image" button is styled consistently across the app, making it clear that this is an actionable element.



## Accessibility and User Experience
- **Responsiveness**: The application is designed to be fully responsive, with a flexible grid layout that adapts to different screen sizes. This ensures a seamless user experience across devices.
- **Readability**: Font sizes, color contrasts, and button sizes are chosen to enhance readability and accessibility. Clear headings and well-spaced content make it easy to scan the information.
- **Interactivity**: Key interactive elements, such as buttons for viewing Pokémon details and toggling caught status, are prominently displayed and styled for easy recognition.
